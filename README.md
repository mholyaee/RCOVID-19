# RCOVID-19
This source code is related to our published dataset named as RCOVID-19. By applying this code you can generate CGR picture as well as corrosponding RQA features for any arbitary genomic sequences. 
## Requirement:
1) This program is suitable for MATLAB R2013a and above versions. 
2) Please download and install CRP Toolbox 5.22.; it is used to extract RQA features.

## Running the method
It can be executed by calling GetCRP function. It needs an input file with fasta format which contains genomic sequences. sample.txt file can be used as a template.
Finally, the output of the program will be two excel files with titles Genome_Info and Genome_RQA. which the first involves the information of analyzed genomic sequences and the later includes their corrosponding RQA features.
Morovere, In the current path, a folder with title CGR is created which contains the CGR measures of each sequence individually.
